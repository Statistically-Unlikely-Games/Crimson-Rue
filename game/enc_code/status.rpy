        Adds the dict to Ren'Py's persistent variables.

        Used only if an Encyclopaedia is not tied to a save game state and should
        unlock entries across all save games.

        This creates the variables, but it's up to you to use them in
        the "viewed" argument for an EncEntry.

        This function must always be called in an init python block.

        Args:
            total (int): Number of entries to create.
            master_key (str): Name of the key prefix. ie: {<master_key>_01: None}
            status_name (str): Name of the persistent variable.

        Returns:
            bool: True if persistent dict created, False if not
